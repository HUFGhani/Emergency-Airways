This project will prototype and develop a life-saving app, aimed initially to enhance training for the management of critical airway emergencies and, later, to assist with early emergency response.

An existing collaboration with the Manchester University NHS Foundation Trustâ€™s intensive care unit will provide initial functional specifications and facilitate testing. It is expected that the software developed will be Open Source to benefit the wider community and later integrated and released in a wider effort for enhancing the delivery of training and care across the NHS.
